		<div id="main-image"><a href = "Images/official.jpg"><img src="Images/official.jpg" width= "500" height = "500" /></a></div>
		
		<h3><strong>EARLY LIFE</strong></h3>

		<p>I was born and raised in Parua location, West Pokot County, Kapenguria, Kenya. I went to Parua Primary School for my primary and Chewoyet High School for the secondary education. Both schools are located in West Pokot County. The county is in the North-Western part of Kenya. The community's main economic activity is livestock keeping and farming.</p>
		
		<p>I was born to a family of seven. My parents practice subsistence farming. They did not attain any formal education but they ensured that my siblings and I all went to school.</p>

		<p>I came to the US in 2013 courtesy of <a href ="http://kensap.org/" target ="_blank">KENSAP Scholarship </a>. I would say KENSAP program was the best thing that happened to me. It had always been my dream to study abroad but I never knew it was going to come through.</p>

		<p>Having grown up in the rural village in West Pokot, Kenya, coming to the US was a tremendous eye opening. Over my last four years at Brandeis University, I have met incredible people, made amazing friends, expanded my network of friends, learnt a little bit about different cultures and most importantly pursued COMPUTER SCIENCE and ECONOMICS - courses I never had any previous experience with!</p>

		<p>Now that I'm close to graduation - May, 2017, I'm looking forward to securing a job in Software Engineering as I have a great passion in technology and with my degree in Computer Science and Economics, I hope to gain experience that will enable me to start my own consulting IT company in the next few years to come</p>

		<p>I'm also working on projects back home to inspire the hundreds of young adults to pursue their dreams. Having received my primary and high school education in my home county of West Pokot, I deeply understand the challenges that the community face. It's my plan to establish programs in the community that will give the students opportunity to access facilities they completely lack at the moment. These include electricity supply, internet connectivity, and better learning materials. It's my great desire to pass the message to those still in their primary and high school education in the village that THEIR DREAMS ARE VALID and that they should never give up despite the challenges they face!. If I made it with the very limited resources, so too they can!</p>

<div id= "Projects"></div>
<div style = "background-color: #DEE1AA">
<h1 style = "color: black"> <strong>PROJECTS</strong></h1>
<div class ="section">PROJECT 1: UXCHANGE</div>

<p>This was a class project for my Human-Computer Interaction Class with Prof. Richard Alterman. The project was designed for students to easily sell their items online</p>

<h1 style ="color: black">DESIGN PROBLEM</h1>
<p>Throughout the year, students, staff and the faculty wish to buy, sell or offer for free items they
do not need online. However, the existing platforms are highly disorganized and sometimes are
not safe to use. The process of posting items for sale, searching for items to buy and even paying
for such items is frustrating, time consuming and annoying. Therefore, our project will focus on
the following design problems:

<ol>
		<li> A tagging system to allow users shopping for items (buyers) to easily check if what
	they are looking for is currently being sold and allow users selling items (sellers) to
	classify their items as they wish</li>
		<li>An integrated messaging system to allow for easy and faster communication between
	the users</li>
		<li>A rating system (five-star rating system) in which users can rate each other after
	transactions</li>
		<li>A notification system so that users can be notified depending on their preferences (ex.
	when they receive a message, when a new item is posted for the tags of their interest)</li>
		<li>A favoriting/removing system whereby users can swipe to remove items they are not
	interested in or favorite items they wish to have easy access to</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br>

<h1 style ="color: black">PROBLEM SPACE </h1>
<p>Posting items for sale and searching for items to buy in the current existing social platforms is
painful process to most users. Users have to go through a long registration process to create
accounts and when they post items for sale they do not tag them on different categories. This
means that users buying items through the platform have to spend a lot of time searching for
items to buy due to the high disorganization of the platforms. Most of the platforms also do not
have integrated messaging system or other efficient means of communication which causes
communication breakdown between users. As a result, the process becomes time consuming,
frustrating, confusing and annoying to the users. Many users would want these platforms to have
a tagging system to allow users shopping for different items to easily check if what they are
looking to buy is currently being sold, an integrated messaging system to allow for easy and
faster communication between users and a five-star rating system in which users can rate each
other after transactions. Users with higher rates can easily find someone to buy their products as
higher ratings gives a mental idea of what other users think of a particular person during and
after the transaction interactional process. Items with higher ratings will also be placed on top of
the specific category that the item belong</p>

<div style = "background-color: #EAEF5A">
<div class ="section">PROJECT 2: E-FARMERS</div>
<p>This was a project we worked on for my Software Entrepreneurship class with Professor Pito Salas </p>

<h1 style ="color:black">MISION AND VISION</h1>
<p>Our mission is to revolutionize the way farmers carry out farming and conduct agribusiness by
introducing modern technology. Through our mobile app, we offer farmers and businesses a
central, online marketplace to shop for better prices and better quality. Farmers who need
superior equipment at low prices, businesses looking for better deals on products, and even
businessmen looking to lease and own land will now have an up-to-date, advanced community in
which to shop for the best deals.
We want to be the safest, most efficient and most effective medium in which farmers can sell and
advertise their products, get agricultural news, and get advice on where to buy genuine farm
equipment. We hope businesses will welcome this direct-to-producer interface in which they can
negotiate for and get better agricultural decisions without the need or expense of a middleman</p>
<br>

<h1 style ="color:black">ELEVATOR PITCH</h1>
<p>Are you a farmer interested in expanding your customer base or a business in need of better
quality produce? Do you need a better market to shop for quality goods and services? We’re
building an app that will help farmers all over the world connect with willing buyers and sellers
of produce, farming tools, and supplies. With an entire marketplace available to businesses and
farmers, we can expand the global environment for trade and help thousands - if not millions - of
farmers get better prices for their produce and help businesses get more bang for their buck</p>

<h1 style = "color: black">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Kenya has the largest and the most diversified economy in East Africa. Agriculture is the
backbone of the country's economy and the government has put a lot of measures and strategies
for agricultural development. The sector accounts for more than 25% of the country's total gross
domestic product (GDP). However, the sector faces myriad of challenges, some of which include
poor infrastructure - such as roads - which lead to high transportation costs for agricultural tools,
inputs and products. It also leads to spoilage of perishable commodities during transportation
causing high losses to farmers. Lack of information on the side of the farmers due to limited
spread of technology makes them miss out on the improved methods of farming and selling their
products to the right markets at the right prices.
Finding a market for agricultural products is also another major challenge facing most large and
small scale farmers in the country. Many farmers only sell on market days, missing out on the
bigger customer base. In other cases, middlemen buy their products at low prices taking
advantage of the fact that the farmers do not have enough knowledge on the price of their
products in other markets. Businesses miss out on the opportunity to buy quality goods at an
affordable price because they are unaware or unable to participate.
E-Farmers was created in an attempt to allow both parties - producers and consumers - an
opportunity to conduct business at a fair price. We want to create an online, global marketplace,
like Amazon and eBay, to allow the fair transaction of goods at an affordable price. Farmers now
have a large platform to sell their products without the hassle of economic loss they usually face,
as well as access to affordable tools and inputs. In addition to basics, we plan to offer a
consulting feature for farmers and businesses. The consultants would be professionals with a
training in agriculture and business who can offer support on the ground if necessary. Later
implementations of this app would include a GroupBuy or a GroupSell feature, in which
businesses and farmers can buy and sell products in bulk with other businesses and farmers. With
these features and proper in-country groundwork, we expect E-Farmers can help shape and
change the way agribusiness is done in Kenya.
