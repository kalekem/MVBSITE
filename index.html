							<br>
						
							<div id="main-image"><a href = "Images/cleo_official.JPG"><img src="Images/cleo_official.JPG" width= "320" height = "420" /></a></div>
						
							<h3><strong>EARLY LIFE</strong></h3>

							<p>I was born and raised in Parua location, West Pokot County, Kapenguria, Kenya. I went to Parua Primary School for my primary and Chewoyet High School for the secondary education. Both schools are located in <a href = "http://www.westpokot.go.ke/">West Pokot County</a>. The county is in the North-Western part of Kenya. The community's main economic activity is livestock keeping and farming.</p>
						
							<p>I was born to a family of seven. My parents practice subsistence farming. They did not attain any formal education but they ensured that my siblings and I all went to school.</p>

							<p>I came to the US in 2013 courtesy of <a href ="http://kensap.org/" target ="_blank">KENSAP Scholarship </a>. I would say KENSAP program was the best thing that happened to me. It had always been my dream to study abroad but I never knew it was going to come true.</p>

							<p>Having grown up in the rural village in West Pokot, Kenya, coming to the US was a tremendous eye opening. Over my last four years at Brandeis University, I have met incredible people, made amazing friends, expanded my network of friends, learnt a little bit about different cultures and most importantly pursued COMPUTER SCIENCE and ECONOMICS - courses I never had any previous experience with!</p>

							<p>Now that I'm close to graduation - May, 2017, I'm looking forward to securing a job in Software Engineering as I have a great passion in technology and with my degree in Computer Science and Economics, I hope to gain experience that will enable me to start my own consulting IT company in the next few years to come</p>

							<p>I'm also working on projects back home to inspire the hundreds of young adults to pursue their dreams. Having received my primary and high school education in my home county of West Pokot, I deeply understand the challenges that the community face. It's my plan to establish programs in the community that will give the students opportunity to access facilities they completely lack at the moment. These include electricity supply, internet connectivity, and better learning materials. It's my great desire to pass the message to those still in their primary and high school education in the village that THEIR DREAMS ARE VALID and that they should never give up despite the challenges they face!. If I made it with the very limited resources, so too they can!</p>

						<h2 style = "color: white"> <strong>COMPUTER SCIENCE PROJECTS</strong></h2>
						<div class ="section">PROJECT 1: UXCHANGE</div>

						<p>This was a class project for my Human-Computer Interaction Class with Prof. Richard Alterman. The project was designed for students to easily sell their items online</p>

						<h2 style ="color: blue">DESIGN PROBLEM</h2>
						<p>Throughout the year, students, staff and the faculty wish to buy, sell or offer for free items they
						do not need online. However, the existing platforms are highly disorganized and sometimes are
						not safe to use. The process of posting items for sale, searching for items to buy and even paying
						for such items is frustrating, time consuming and annoying. Therefore, our project will focus on
						the following design problems:

						<ul>
							<li> A tagging system to allow users shopping for items (buyers) to easily check if what
							they are looking for is currently being sold and allow users selling items (sellers) to
							classify their items as they wish</li>
							<li>An integrated messaging system to allow for easy and faster communication between
							the users</li>
							<li>A rating system (five-star rating system) in which users can rate each other after
							transactions</li>
							<li>A notification system so that users can be notified depending on their preferences (ex.
							when they receive a message, when a new item is posted for the tags of their interest)</li>
							<li>A favoriting/removing system whereby users can swipe to remove items they are not
							interested in or favorite items they wish to have easy access to</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<br>

						<h2 style ="color: blue">PROBLEM SPACE </h2>
						<p>Posting items for sale and searching for items to buy in the current existing social platforms is
						painful process to most users. Users have to go through a long registration process to create
						accounts and when they post items for sale they do not tag them on different categories. This
						means that users buying items through the platform have to spend a lot of time searching for
						items to buy due to the high disorganization of the platforms. Most of the platforms also do not
						have integrated messaging system or other efficient means of communication which causes
						communication breakdown between users. As a result, the process becomes time consuming,
						frustrating, confusing and annoying to the users. Many users would want these platforms to have
						a tagging system to allow users shopping for different items to easily check if what they are
						looking to buy is currently being sold, an integrated messaging system to allow for easy and
						faster communication between users and a five-star rating system in which users can rate each
						other after transactions. Users with higher rates can easily find someone to buy their products as
						higher ratings gives a mental idea of what other users think of a particular person during and
						after the transaction interactional process. Items with higher ratings will also be placed on top of
						the specific category that the item belong</p>

						<p style="text-align: center;"><a href ="Images/farmers.jpg" ><img src="Images/farmers.jpg"  width = "700" height = "500" alt="Farmers' App"></a></p>

						<p>This was a project we worked on for my Software Entrepreneurship class with Professor Pito Salas </p>

						<h2 style ="color:white">MISION AND VISION</h2>
						<p>Our mission is to revolutionize the way farmers carry out farming and conduct agribusiness by
						introducing modern technology. Through our mobile app, we offer farmers and businesses a
						central, online marketplace to shop for better prices and better quality. Farmers who need
						superior equipment at low prices, businesses looking for better deals on products, and even
						businessmen looking to lease and own land will now have an up-to-date, advanced community in
						which to shop for the best deals.
						<br><br>

						We want to be the safest, most efficient and most effective medium in which farmers can sell and
						advertise their products, get agricultural news, and get advice on where to buy genuine farm
						equipment. We hope businesses will welcome this direct-to-producer interface in which they can
						negotiate for and get better agricultural decisions without the need or expense of a middleman</p>
						<br>

						<h2 style ="color:white">ELEVATOR PITCH</h2>
						<p>Are you a farmer interested in expanding your customer base or a business in need of better
						quality produce? Do you need a better market to shop for quality goods and services? We’re
						building an app that will help farmers all over the world connect with willing buyers and sellers
						of produce, farming tools, and supplies. With an entire marketplace available to businesses and
						farmers, we can expand the global environment for trade and help thousands - if not millions - of
						farmers get better prices for their produce and help businesses get more bang for their buck</p><br>

						<h2 style = "color: white">DESCRIPTION</h2>
						<p>Kenya has the largest and the most diversified economy in East Africa. Agriculture is the
						backbone of the country's economy and the government has put a lot of measures and strategies
						for agricultural development. The sector accounts for more than 25% of the country's total gross
						domestic product (GDP). However, the sector faces myriad of challenges, some of which include
						poor infrastructure - such as roads - which lead to high transportation costs for agricultural tools,
						inputs and products. It also leads to spoilage of perishable commodities during transportation
						causing high losses to farmers. Lack of information on the side of the farmers due to limited
						spread of technology makes them miss out on the improved methods of farming and selling their
						products to the right markets at the right prices.
						<br><br>

						Finding a market for agricultural products is also another major challenge facing most large and
						small scale farmers in the country. Many farmers only sell on market days, missing out on the
						bigger customer base. In other cases, middlemen buy their products at low prices taking
						advantage of the fact that the farmers do not have enough knowledge on the price of their
						products in other markets. Businesses miss out on the opportunity to buy quality goods at an
						affordable price because they are unaware or unable to participate.
						<br><br>

						E-Farmers was created in an attempt to allow both parties - producers and consumers - an
						opportunity to conduct business at a fair price. We want to create an online, global marketplace,
						like Amazon and eBay, to allow the fair transaction of goods at an affordable price. Farmers now
						have a large platform to sell their products without the hassle of economic loss they usually face,
						as well as access to affordable tools and inputs. In addition to basics, we plan to offer a
						consulting feature for farmers and businesses. The consultants would be professionals with a
						training in agriculture and business who can offer support on the ground if necessary. Later
						implementations of this app would include a GroupBuy or a GroupSell feature, in which
						businesses and farmers can buy and sell products in bulk with other businesses and farmers. With
						these features and proper in-country groundwork, we expect E-Farmers can help shape and
						change the way agribusiness is done in Kenya.

						<h1 style ="color: yellow">COMPANY: MATTEL </h1>
						<p>This was a project we did for my BUSINESS 10A with Prof. Edward Bayone. We analyzed Mattel and particularly we focused on the problems facing the company's Barbie product and what the company could do to solve the problem. </p>

						<h1 style ="color:yellow">BACKGROUND</h1>
						<p>Mattel, Inc. was founded in 1945 by Harold "Matt" Matson and Ruth and Elliot Handler . In the
						beginning the company sold picture frames before moving on to dollhouse furniture. Due to poor health,
						Matson soon sold his share to the Handlers. In 1947, the company had its first successful toy,
						"Uke-A-Doodle". The company was formed into a legal corporation the next year in California. In a first
						for marketing, Mattel became a sponsor of the Mickey Mouse Club in 1955. This helped them gain
						visibility in the children’s toy market. The Barbie doll was introduced in 1959, becoming the company's
						best selling toy ever. We will talk much more about this later. In 1960 Mattel introduced a talking doll
						that revolutionized the toy industry, Chatty Cathy. The pull string talking mechanism used for Chatty
						Cathy was implemented in several later toys such as See 'N Say, which was introduced in 1965.
						<br><br>

						Mattel went public in 1960 and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1963. Mattel also
						acquired a number of companies during the 1960s. Another one of Mattel’s flagship products, Hot
						Wheels , was first introduced in 1968. The Handlers left the company in 1974 to pursue other interests.
						<br><br>

						Throughout the 1990s, Mattel acquired many companies. In 1993, 1997, and 1998, Mattel
						purchased Fisher-Price Inc., Tyco Toys , Inc. and Pleasant Company (maker of the American Girl brand),
						respectively. Mattel purchased The Learning Co. in 1999 for $3.5 billion, but sold it in 2000 at a loss. The
						company had a $430.9 million net loss that year.
						<br><br>

						Mattel closed its last factory in the United States in 2002, originally part of the Fisher-Price
						division, outsourcing production to China which began a chain of events that led to a scandal involving
						lead contamination. On August 14, 2007, Mattel recalled over 18 million products because many of them
						had exceeded the US limits set on surface coatings that contain lead. Additional recalls were because it
						was possible that some toys could pose a danger to children due to the use of strong magnets that could
						potentially detach. The recall included 7.1 million Polly Pocket toys produced before November 2006;
						600,000 Barbie and Tanner Playsets; 1 million Doggie Daycare ; Shonen Jump's One Piece; and thousands
						of Batman Manga toys due to exposed magnets . In 2009 Mattel was forced to pay a $2.9 million fine to
						the Consumer Products Safety Commission for marketing, importing, and selling non-compliant toys.
						Mattel was lauded as a gold standard for its crisis response by several publications, including PRWeek ,
						the Los Angeles Times , Fortune Magazine and Business Management .
						<br><br>

						In early 2010, HiT Entertainment licensed Thomas & Friends to Mattel for toys. Mattel agreed to
						purchase HiT Entertainment sans Sprout from Apax Partners group in October 2011 for $680 million. The
						merger was completed on February 1, 2012, and HiT Entertainment became a wholly owned subsidiary of
						Mattel, managed by its Fisher-Price unit.
						<br><br>

						Fortune Magazine named Mattel as one of the top 100 companies to work for in 2013. Only 1,292
						positions were newly filled out of 164,045 job applications during the previous year. Additionally, more
						than 1,000 employees have been with the company longer than 15 years.
						<br><br>

						Mattel launched its small in-house film studio, Playground Productions , in October 2013. This
						was in order handle multi-media production, films, TV shows, web series, live events, and games for
						Mattel's brands. Its first animated project is “ Team Hot Wheels: The Origin of Awesome ”. Mattel has
						under development a live-action Hot Wheels movie at Legendary Entertainment , a He-Man movie at
						Columbia, a Monster High feature with Universal and a Max Steel movie with Dolphin Entertainment. On
						February 28, 2014, Mattel acquired Mega Brands.</p>
						<br>
						<h1 style ="color:yellow">BARBIE'S PROBLEMS</h1>
						<p>Barbie was initially portrayed as a ‘teenage fashion model'. However, throughout the growth of
						the doll, she has portrayed more than hundred and twenty five career options some of which represent
						politics, different cultures and social norms. The original image Barbie portrayed was a clean-cut image
						that reminded mothers of their youthful age, along with a motivational female character that could do
						anything and be anyone (Cook, 2003). This created a very dominant position in the doll market.
						<br><br>

						As the product line continued to develop, negative images started surfacing in regards to body
						image, and self-perception. People started to blame Barbie because of how her body presented unrealistic
						proportions, which created bad publicity for the doll (Open For Business, 2011). But because Barbie
						herself is such a large mogul, having two dolls sold every second, much of this negative publicity did not
						affect the overall popularity of Barbie (Open For Business, 2011). Mattel stayed quite solid with market
						share gains since October 2010 and on April 15th, 2011, Barbie assisted Mattel in winning the market
						share ( (Businessweek.com & Staff, 2010). By beating quarterly sales expectations, Mattel’s shares
						increased by 5 percent (Best Growth Stock, 2011). However, in October 2014, the company seemed to be
						“ grappling with sluggish toy sales as kids spend more time playing on electronic devices. Total revenue
						also fell for a fourth straight period, with worldwide sales of Barbie dropping 21 percent and Fisher-Price
						toys falling 16 percent” (Bloomberg).
						<br><br>

						This Sharp drop in Barbie’s sales was partly self-inflicted since the company over-shipped the
						product to retailers, leaving them overloaded in inventory when it didn’t sell. It also heavily marketed the
						Barbie Dream-house, which sold for $150, leaving parents little extra to spend on smaller items</p>
						<br>
						<h1 style ="color:yellow">WHAT SHOULD THE MANAGEMENT DO</h1>
						<p>We performed a SWOT analysis of the Barbie brand in order to inform our recommendations for
						Mattel going forward.</p><br><br>

						<p><a href ="Images/swot.png" ><img src="Images/swot.png"  width = "500" height = "500" alt="Swot Analysis"></a></p>


						<strong style="color:yellow">STRENGTHS-</strong><br><br>
						<p>Barbie has incredible brand awareness. Ninety percent of American girls ages three to 10 own at
						least one Barbie. But Barbie’s brand recognition and success is not limited to the United States. Barbie
						has been in Europe since 1961. She has was been in India since 1987. She has her own awards show
						honoring inspirational women each year in Mexico. In the Caribbean, she even has a her own Barbie
						Experience cruse. Barbie is the largest toy property in the world with global sales topping $1 billion.
						Many dolls have come and gone but Barbie has proved that she has a special kind of resonance during her
						54 years. Barbie has also distinguished herself through her versatile wardrobe and array of accessories.
						She has outfits for virtually every occasion and almost every mainstream profession imaginable. Right
						now Barbie is experiencing her “I Can Be” campaign, in which she has outfits for everything from flight
						attendant to pop singer. 
						<br><br>

						The brand has also diversified, to some capacity, beyond dolls. It extended its
						name to straight-to-video movies, clothing and computer games. Barbie also has her collectibles, which
						are sold and advertised separately such as the Dream House, Ponies, etc. Another current strength of the
						brand is its Purchasing power is increasing in emerging market. It gives reason to believe that there is
						going to be stronger demand from these markets for traditional toys as income levels directly impact
						discretionary spending. As we mentioned ealier, China and Russia both are growing markets. Sources at
						Mattel have said toy sales in 2013 tripled in Russia and nearly doubled in China. Barbie is also doing
						very well in places Romania and Mexico. Its market share is 30 and 40 percent higher then Monster
						High’s in those countries respectively.<br><br>


						<strong style="color:yellow">WEAKNESSES -</strong><br><br>
						One of Barbies clear weaknesses the controversiality surrounding Barbie’s image. For almost as
						long as the Barbie has existed, she has been criticized for the unrealistic standard of beauty that she sets
						for little girls. Many people believe that Barbie dolls reinforce gender stereotypes and encourage
						objectification of women. Recently, Mattel received a lot of flack for the Barbie book “I Can Be a
						Computer Engineer”. The book depicts Barbie as a computer engineer who apparently cannot fix her
						broken computer without the help of her male friends Brian and Steven. Mattel has apologized for the
						book, saying “the portrayal of Barbie in this specific story doesn’t reflect the Brand’s vision for what
						Barbie stands for. We believe girls should be empowered to understand that anything is possible and
						believe they live in a world without limits”. Needless to say, this mishap did not help Mattel fight the
						negative conceptions of its flagship product. Barbie’s other weakness is the flip side of one of its
						strengths, its longevity. Any brand, that has been around as long as Barbie needs to regularly reinvent
						itself. It requires a lot of creative energy to constantly come up with new ways make a classic brand seem
						like new again. This most likely is a big factor in Barbie’s free falling doll sales. Its sales have fallen for
						nine consecutive quarters now, in the last four quarters sales have fallen by double digits. Though Barbie
						still is on top of the global doll market, her longterm future in that spot is uncertain.
						<br><br>

						Opportunities -
						Barbie dolls primary demographic these days is children 3 to 6. Starting at 7, Boys tend to go for
						computer and video games, and girls become more interested in music, clothes, make-up, television talent
						shows and celebrities. Research has shown that more than two-thirds of kids between in the age group of
						7-13 years old opt for a tech gadget instead of a toy. Dolls and action figures get left behind. Mattel could
						use this as an opportunity to turn Barbie into a truly multimedia brand. Mattel has already taken steps
						towards achieving this. For example Mattel has released about 20 direct-to-video movies since 2001.
						These films are generally stand alone films that feature Barbie as a heroine of several princess or
						fairy-themed stories to accompany a franchise of related dolls and accessories. Barbie also has its own
						web series, “Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse”, which is specifically targeted at slightly older girls.
						<br><br>

						Additionally Mattel has created a Barbie app that allows the user to create customized Barbie outfits.
						These are all important changes that Mattel needed to make to reclaim its former demographic footholds,
						but it is not enough. Mattel should be more aggressive with expansion into other forms of media. This
						strategy has paid off very handsomely for one of Mattel’s biggest rivals, Lego. Lego in recent years has
						vigorously extended its brand to video games, television programs and even feature film. Lego has
						produced a string of popular video games based on well known movie franchises such as Star Wars,
						Indiana Jones and Batman. They also have successful television programs on popular children's’
						networks like Cartoon Network, such as their ninja-based show “Lego Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu”.
						They even produced a feature length, The Lego Movie, which made $468 million worldwide and boosted
						Lego’s revenue from sales by 15 percent in first half of 2014 compared with the same period last year.
						Mattel ought to take the same approach. until recently Mattel was still treating Barbie.com as an
						advertising forum, rather than as a money-earning product directly integrated with the sale of physical
						toys. If a toy company wants to be successful in the twenty first century it must master the technological
						mediums that occupy today’s youth.

						<br><br>
						
						<strong style="color:yellow">THREATS -</strong><br><br>
						As we discussed earlier, according to the survey by the National Retail Federation, Barbie is not
						the most coveted toy for girls this holiday season. toys based on characters from the movie Frozen have
						become unbelievably popular. This is the first time in the eleven year history of the survey that Barbie
						does not top the list. About 20 percent of parents plan to buy “Frozen” gifts for their daughters. 16.8
						percent of parents plan on buying Barbies. Generic Dolls got 10.7 percent, Monster High Dolls 5.2
						percent and American Girl 3.8 percent. Fortunately, Mattel owns all the name brand dolls that top this list,
						though not for long. The right to produce the Frozen dolls, along with other dolls based on Disney
						character will transfer over to Hasbro in 2016. The success of Frozen merchandise, and Monster High
						American and American Girl merchandise to a lesser extent, has come at Barbie’s expense. Essentially,
						Mattel’s doll brands are partially cannibalizing each other’s sales. One of Mattel’s other big threats, as
						mentioned in the opportunity section is age compression. Barbie’s target audience used to be 3 to 11, not
						its about 2 to 6. The demographic range that Barbie appeals to has shrunk because children are now more
						then ever racing to be like their teenage peers. Children want to get older faster. This has been bad news
						for no just Barbie but the entire toy industry. Children see their older brothers and sisters with playing
						with tech gadgets and they want them too.
						<br><br>
						
						<strong style="color:yellow">RECOMMENDATION -</strong><br><br>
						Based on our analysis of the company we recommend that Mattel more aggressively expand
						Barbie’s presence to other mediums, such as video games, television and feature length film. Barbie’s
						efforts to utilize those mediums, by doing things like creating the “Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse” web
						series and creating the Barbie clothing app, were steps in the right direction. Barbie has done a
						particularly good job making use of social media. However, what they have done so far is not enough.
						There is still plenty of room for the Barbie brand to do more. If done, right as it was with Lego it could
						mean huge payoffs for Mattel. Just to illustrate the power a popular film, Frozen dolls did not exist more
						two years ago but now young girls are singing Frozen songs at every turn and Frozen toys are flying off
						the shelves. A feature length film could just be what Mattel needs to revitalize Barbie. Video and
						computer games and television need to be a key part of this strategy as well though. This is because a
						child is not going to sit down and watch the same full length film everyday (generally speaking). What
						they will do is run to their computer after school to play their favorite computer games. They may also
						come home and watch television. 
						<br><br>

						Barbie’s web series is doing relatively well but young children still
						watch most of their show on an actual television. All of these things will not just produce revenue on their
						own Hasbro but they will almost certainly boost Barbie doll sales. Hasbro one of Mattel’s other rivals,
						has found that “Kids who are playing Monopoly at home on the Wii will be more likely to play the games
						in a board format”. If children are playing with something online or seeing it on a screen they are are
						more likely to want a real life counterpart. In emerging markets Barbie does not yet to vigorously expand
						its brand because, generally speaking, most developing nations have not had Barbie for that long. It sales
						are strengthening in places like China, Russia, Mexico, India, Romania and other countries. Though if
						Barbie wants to maintain her queendom in the developed markets, she is going to need to implement these
						changes to bring her into the twenty first century.

						<h3 style ="color: white">COMPANY(s): HASBRO AND MATTEL </h3>
						<p>This was my FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING class project with Prof. Hagit Weihs</p><br>
						<h1 style ="color:white">BACKGROUND</h1>
						<p>Hasbro, Inc. and Mattel, Inc. are two of the most recognized toy companies in the U.S.
						They operate in the toys & games industry, where competition is fierce and abundant and
						economic success depends on following market trends. Toy companies must embrace innovation
						in order to set themselves apart from their competition. Mattel, deemed the #1 toy manufacturer
						on the globe by Hoover’s, offers famous brands such as Barbie and Fisher-Price Toys (“Mattel,
						Inc”). Hasbro Inc, deemed #2, offers the classic Play-doh and Milton Bradley games (“Hasbro,
						Inc”). Top competitors in the industry include JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and LEGO</p>
						<br>
						<strong style ="color: white">INTERPRETATION OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</strong>
						<br>
						<p>The most significant change in Hasbro’s income statement — despite it being a small
						monetary amount — is in the amortization of intangibles expense. As shown in the trend income
						statement, this amount increased by 67% between 2011 and 2013, and as shown by the
						common-size income statement, this figure almost doubled in terms of percentage of sales. This
						increase reflects an increase among expenses, as shown particularly by the common-size income
						statement, which reflects that, relative to sales, all but one expense (advertising) has increased
						since 2011. This general increase in relative expense costs has had a detrimental effect on the net
						income, which is down 30% in pure figures and from 9% to 7% relative to sales.
						There was a significant spike in cash and cash equivalents in 2012, likely due in part to
						the corresponding spike in short-term borrowings in the same year, particularly since sales were
						down in 2012 from 2011. Cash and cash equivalents returned to their pre-2012 value (around
						$650,000) in 2013, probably largely because the company paid back a significant portion of their
						short-term borrowings in 2013. This is a relatively normal business activity, and therefore is not
						cause for concern.</p>
						<br><br>

						<strong style="color:white">FINANCIAL RATIOS INTERPRETATION</strong><br>
						<p>The current ratio calculates a company’s ability to pay short-term liabilities with
						short-term assets (Libby 458). For the last two years, Hasbro has demonstrated an overall better
						use of short-term assets to pay for short-term liabilities. Both companies had ratios over 2.0 at
						one point, meaning they used their funds inefficiently. Hasbro has become the stronger company
						by improving its management techniques over time, increasing efficiency. The managers have
						control over their short-term debt, which will, in turn maximize returns for their shareholders.<br><br>

						The quick ratio measures a company’s quick assets against its current liabilities, which
						demonstrates a company’s ability to quickly settle their current liabilities (Libby 458). What
						constitutes a good quick ratio is largely dependent on industry benchmarks. The ratio rises as
						quick assets (in relation to current liabilities) increase. Hasbro’s quick ratio has decreased from
						1.96 to 1.30 between 2012 and 2013, whereas Mattel’s has increased from 1.49 to 2.20 in the
						same time. It seems that Mattel is using its quick assets less effectively; they have more than
						twice as much cash and cash equivalents as they do current liabilities, so they should be using
						that cash to invest in the company. Therefore, Hasbro has the stronger quick ratio.
						<br><br>

						The gross profit percentage measures a company’s ability to charge premium prices and
						produce goods and services at low costs. All other things equal, a higher gross profit results in
						higher net income (Libby 284). Hasbro’s gross profit/margin has not changed for the last two
						years because the changes in the net sales and cost of goods sold are almost the same. For Mattel,
						the gross margin for the last two years has seen a slight increase from 0.53 to 0.54.
						The increase in gross margin was as a result of Mattel’s increase of net sales in 2013 and a decline in the cost
						of goods sold.Mattel demonstrates a stronger ratio.

						<br><br>

						Profit margin measures how much of every sales dollar generated during the period is
						profit (Libby 182). Hasbro’s profit margin had a 12.5% decrease from 2012 to 2013. This
						decrease was due to an increase in expenses which eventually increased the costs, reducing the
						net revenues/ income. Mattel however did a better job of controlling its sales and costs, making
						its profit ratio increase about 16.7%. This indicates higher efficiency in the management of sales
						and expenses by Mattel.
						<br><br>

						Operating margin determines how much money a company is making in profit from its
						operating activities (Libby 182). Hasbro’s operating margin decreased by 15.4%. This decrease
						was a result of high operating expenses witnessed in 2013. These expenses decreased the net
						operating profit which lowered the ratio. Mattel, however, has realized more profit from its
						operating activities, increasing from 0.16 to 0.18. This increase in Mattel’s profit margin was a
						result of the lower expenses realized in 2013 in comparison to prior years. The lower operating
						costs increased the operating income, increasing the company’s operating margin. Mattel
						performs better in terms of realizing profit from its operating activities.

						<br><br>

						The asset turnover ratio measures the sales generated per dollar of assets (Libby 127).
						Hasbro’s asset turnover decreased from 0.97 to 0.94. The decrease in the ratio was due to an
						increase in Hasbro’s assets in the year 2013. This indicates that Hasbro was less effective in
						using its assets to generate sales. Mattel’s asset turnover ratio also decreased from 1.05 to 1.00.
						This decrease in the ratio was due to significant increase of total assets in 2013, which also
						increased average assets. Compared to Mattel, Hasbro has better management of its assets to
						generate sales.
						<br><br>

						The ROE is useful for comparing the profitability of a company to that of other firms in
						the same industry (Libby 702). The decrease from 0.23 in 2012 to 0.18 in 2013, for Hasbro
						indicates that there was a decrease in profitability. An increase from 0.27 to 0.29 indicates an
						increase in profitability for Mattel, making them the stronger company. Mattel’s largest
						customers include “Wal-Mart at $1.2 billion, Toys “R” Us at $0.7 billion and Target at $0.5
						billion” (Mattel Annual Report 8).
						<br><br>

						ROA tells us what earnings were generated from invested capital (Libby 250). A decrease
						in ROA for Hasbro, from 0.08 to 0.07 indicates a decrease in these earnings. An increase for
						Mattel from 0.13 to 0.14 indicates an increase in these earnings.
						<br><br>

						Financial leverage is the degree to which a company uses fixed-income securities such as
						debt and preferred equity (“Complete Guide to Corporate Finance”). The more debt financing a
						company uses, the higher its financial leverage. A decrease in financial leverage, from 2.89 to
						2.74 indicates less debt financing for Hasbro. A decrease from 2.15 to 2.05 indicates the same for
						Mattel.
						<br><br>

						Accounts receivable turnover is calculated using net credit sales and trade receivables
						(Libby 292). Hasbro and Mattel sell mostly to retailers, meaning most of their sales are on credit.
						From this, we can assume that total accounts receivable is equal to trade receivables. Mattel has a
						higher ratio for both years, revealing that the company collects cash about five times per year.
						Hasbro only collects three times per year. Mattel is the stronger company in terms of
						credit-granting and collections.
						<br><br>

						Days in accounts receivable is calculated by dividing 365 by the accounts receivable
						turnover ratio. The ratio reveals the average amount of days it takes to collect payments, which
						should not exceed 1.5 times the terms of credit granting (Libby 460). A high ratio would imply
						that the company needs to be more strict about its collections. Hasbro collects in 92-94 days.
						Mattel collects in only 70 days. This is in agreement with the accounts receivable turnover ratio:
						Mattel is the stronger company.
						<br><br>

						The inventory turnover ratio is a representation of the amount of times in a year a
						company’s inventory was acquired and sold, measuring liquidity and general efficiency (Libby
						347). Hasbro’s inventory turnover ratio decreased from 5.14 to 5.03; Mattel’s decreased from
						6.33 to 5.81. Both of these decreases suggest a decrease in liquidity and efficiency. Sometimes,
						an inventory turnover ratio can be too high, but in the toys and games industry, merchandise
						changes more often than in other industries, requiring a higher inventory turnover. Mattel
						maintains the higher inventory turnover ratio, which indicates higher efficiency.
						<br><br>

						The days in inventory is calculated by dividing 365 by the inventory turnover ratio, so it
						is inversely correlated to the inventory turnover ratio (Libby 347). Hasbro’s days in inventory
						has increased from about 71 to about 73; Mattel’s has increased from about 58 to about 63.
						These increases are congruent with the decreases in the inventory turnover ratio showed: Both
						companies are likely becoming less efficient, but Mattel seems to be more efficient than Hasbro.
						<br><br>

						The accounts payable turnover ratio is a representation for how many times a year the
						company pays for its inventory (Libby 460). Hasbro’s accounts payable turnover decreased from
						about 12 to about 10; Mattel’s decreased slightly from 8.30 to 8.18. Relating this to their relative
						inventory turnover ratios, they both pay for their inventory more quickly than they sell their
						inventory, which is generally a negative. Mattel is the stronger company.
						<br><br>

						The days in accounts payable is inversely correlated to the accounts payable turnover
						(Libby 460). Hasbro’s days in accounts payable increased from about 30 to about 36; Mattel’s
						increased from 44 to 45. The days in accounts payable shows that accounts payable is settled
						more quickly than inventory is sold, which is unfavorable, but Mattel is stronger than Hasbro.
						<br><br>

						The cash conversion cycle calculates the period of time it takes a company to receive
						resource inputs and convert them to cash flows (“Cash Conversion Cycle”). Mattel’s low ratio
						suggests better liquidity, with money moving quickly through inventory, accounts payable, and
						accounts receivable. Businesses with high ratios may have to resort to lowering prices in order to
						get rid of inventory. Mattel’s lower cash conversion cycle implies better management of assets
						and liabilities, making them the stronger company.
						<br><br>

						The allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable ratio deals with a company’s
						projected credit collections/uncollectibles. A higher ratio suggests that there is a greater risk to
						the company for a larger amount of write-offs. For both Hasbro and Mattel, allowance for
						doubtful accounts have decreased over the last two years, but Mattel’s has decreased to below
						Hasbro’s. Even though there were not any large fluctuations in accounts receivable for either
						company, Mattel managed to reduce the uncollectibility on its credit sales.
						<br><br>

						The debt-to-equity ratio provides information about how much capital a company
						receives from its owners versus its creditors. A high ratio suggests that the company relies
						heavily on creditor funds. (Libby 712) Neither company’s ratio is too high, which implies that
						both Mattel and Hasbro have a good capital structure. Relying too much on debt could result in
						bankruptcy if sales do not exceed these liabilities. Mattel demonstrates better capital structure by
						receiving more funds from owners than creditors, which is less risky, making it the stronger
						company.
						<br><br>

						The times interest earned ratio is largely used by creditors to determine a company’s
						ability to pay its interest, based on its net income before interest and taxes. A higher ratio is
						generally better, meaning net income is higher in relation to the interest expense. (Libby 712)
						Hasbro’s ratio decreased from 4.97 to 3.33; Mattel’s increased from 10.64 to 14.00. Mattel’s
						times interest earned ratio is significantly higher than Hasbro’s, meaning that creditors will be
						more willing to invest in Mattel because it has greater security.
						<br><br>

						The dividend payout ratio reveals total dividends paid to stockholders, in relation to total
						net income (Libby 713). Hasbro’s ratio decreases in 2013 while Mattel is consistent. The growth
						rate is calculated using the return on equity and dividend payout ratios. Mattel has the higher
						growth rate for last two years, and both companies were generally consistent in their numbers.
						This formula takes into consideration steady income versus reinvestment for possible future
						earnings, assuming the company has a net income. The decrease in dividends and net income
						implies that Hasbro did poorly in 2013 in comparison to 2012. Mattel has continued to perform
						well while increasing both its net income and dividends for last two years. Mattel is growing at a
						consistent, higher rate than Hasbro.</p>
